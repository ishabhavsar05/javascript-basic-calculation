<!-- 3) Write code that demonstrates the difference between let and const.Create two variables, 
 one using let to store a student's grade (which can change) and another using const to store their 
 name (which shouldn't change). Modify the grade variable but attempt to modify the name variable. 
 Observe the outcome. -->
